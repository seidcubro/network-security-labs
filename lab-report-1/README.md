# Lab 1 – Threat Modeling a Real System

## Course
CS 355 – Network Security

## Overview
This lab develops a practical **threat model** for a real-world operational environment.  
The selected system is the **FedEx Ground warehouse facility in Pittston, PA (SCRA-0185)**.

The report identifies critical assets, defines trust boundaries, analyzes credible threat scenarios, and prioritizes mitigations based on risk.

---

## Topics Covered
- Asset identification
- Trust boundary analysis
- Threat modeling
- Likelihood and impact assessment
- Risk-based mitigation prioritization
- Incident response considerations

---

## Methodology
The analysis follows guidance from:
- CS 355 Network Security course materials
- NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (Risk Assessment)
- NIST SP 800-61r3 (Incident Response)

Threats are evaluated using a qualitative **likelihood × impact** model consistent with NIST recommendations.
